This is a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) 4.2.0 application using [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org) as it's database.  Rails 4.2 was chosen as it was the most current stable version of the framework at the time it was created.

### Styling

Styling incorporates [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) along with a modified version of the [Creative](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative) theme.  Further animations and effects are accomplished using [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css), [WOW.js](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW), [Boostrap-Progressbar](https://github.com/geersch/bootstrap-progressbar) and [jQuery Circliful](https://github.com/pguso/jquery-plugin-circliful).
